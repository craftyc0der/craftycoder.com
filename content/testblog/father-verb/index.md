A brief examination at the above chart shows a startling coincidence of nontraditional family creation styles and aggregate economic success. It is not controversial to say that Black Americans have less success in the economy in aggregate than White Americans. Likewise, it is not controversial to say that White Americans have less success in the economy in aggregate than Asian Americans.

</div>

We all have an intuition about these income numbers[^1], but it worth looking at them briefly. Much hay is made about the fact that White Americans earn more than Black Americans. Many point to this proof of systemic racism. Andrew Sullivan wrote about this in New York Magazine back in 2017[^2].

> Asian-Americans, like Jews, are indeed a problem for the “social-justice” brigade. I mean, how on earth have both ethnic groups done so well in such a profoundly racist society? How have bigoted white people allowed these minorities to do so well — even to the point of earning more, on average, than whites? Asian-Americans, for example, have been subject to some of the most brutal oppression, racial hatred, and open discrimination over the years. In the late 19th century, as most worked in hard labor, they were subject to lynchings and violence across the American West and laws that prohibited their employment. They were banned from immigrating to the U.S. in 1924. Japanese-American citizens were forced into internment camps during the Second World War, and subjected to hideous, racist propaganda after Pearl Harbor. Yet, today, Asian-Americans are among the most prosperous, well-educated, and successful ethnic groups in America. What gives? It couldn’t possibly be that they maintained solid two-parent family structures, had social networks that looked after one another, placed enormous emphasis on education and hard work, and thereby turned false, negative stereotypes into true, positive ones, could it? It couldn’t be that all whites are not racists or that the American dream still lives? — <cite>Andrew Sullivan</cite>

His position sounds reasonable to this reader but, others see something more sinister. NPR wrote in response to his piece[^3] that

> at the root of Sullivan's pernicious argument is the idea that black failure and Asian success cannot be explained by inequities and racism, and that they are one and the same; this allows a segment of white America to avoid any responsibility for addressing racism or the damage it continues to inflict. — <cite>Kat Chow, NPR</cite>

<div class="float-right">
{{< thumbd src="asianpoc.png" title="White/Asians" target="asianpoc" width="200" class="rounded" >}}
</div>

Ellen D. Wu went on to describe Sullivan's take as "*an old-fashioned rendering*" and "*very retro in the kinds of points he made*". What I didn't read was a compelling argument as to why he was actually wrong. Arguments are made saying that exclusion laws and internment camps were nothing compared to the discrimination Black Americans continue to endure. I'm not certain how you would measure that but I have never heard any more than the assertion made and outcomes shown as evidence. A school district in Washington has a convenient way to solve this problem. Asians are not *People of Color* anymore[^4]. Problem solved!

Could the outcomes be caused by something else? While it is extremely unpopular to discuss, there are data that show differences in race and IQ that line up with these outcomes. Likewise, these family structures also appear to line up. For some reason the *popular* excuse for these disparities is White racism. I am offended by being scapegoated for something that I am quite certain I did not do. This, it is argued, is my White Fragility is showing. Perhaps it is. Perhaps, abdicating personal responsibility is very pleasant for the soul and White Americans are a convenient target for their odium.

### The Moynihan Report

In 1965, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an Assistant Secretary of Labor, wrote his famous report *The Negro Family: The Case For National Action*[^5]. It argues that the destruction of the Black family is the cause of the widening gap is outcomes of Black Americans.

> The fundamental problem, in which this is most clearly the case, is that of family structure. The evidence — not final, but powerfully persuasive — is that the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling. A middle class group has managed to save itself, but for vast numbers of the unskilled, poorly educated city working class the fabric of conventional social relationships has all but disintegrated. There are indications that the situation may have been arrested in the past few years, but the general post war trend is unmistakable. So long as this situation persists, the cycle of poverty and disadvantage will continue to repeat itself.

> The thesis of this paper is that these events, in combination, confront the nation with a new kind of problem. Measures that have worked in the past, or would work for most groups in the present, will not work here. A national effort is required that will give a unity of purpose to the many activities of the Federal government in this area, directed to a new kind of national goal: the establishment of a stable Negro family structure. — <cite>Moynihan Report</cite>

It is worth mentioning, that at the time of this writing, the percentage of Black children growing up in a household without their father was about 25%. ***Now it is near 70%***. Nearly tripling since the report was written.

Thomas Sowell, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute echoed Moynihan when he wrote:

> You cannot take any people, of any color, and exempt them from the requirements of civilization — including work, behavioral standards, personal responsibility and all the other basic things that the clever intelligentsia disdain — without ruinous consequences to them and to society at large.

> Non-judgmental subsidies of counterproductive lifestyles are treating people as if they were livestock, to be fed and tended by others in a welfare state — and yet expecting them to develop as human beings have developed when facing the challenges of life themselves.

> One key fact that keeps getting ignored is that the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits every year since 1994. Behavior matters and facts matter, more than the prevailing social visions or political empires built on those visions. — <cite>Thomas Sowell[^6]</cite>

He blames, in part, the welfare state for these outcomes. The welfare state basically immunizes people from suffering the full cost of their bad choices. Obviously, its real goal is protect people from negative outcomes they are not to blame for. This means, of course, that it is pretty important that blame is accurately ascribed. Otherwise, you might end up perpetuating problems you do not desire or intend to.

### Why are Fathers Important?

We all have anecdotal reasons why father's are important. We know, for example, that the family is more important in our development than the state. We also know that our genes play an important to our development as well, however. Even without our father's present, we still get to enjoy their genes. Is that enough?

As a father, I certainly would like to think I am more important than my genes. The table below shows the results of a meta-analysis of twins studies. These studies are used to tease apart the relative value genes and environment on behavior. I was introduced to this one in the book *Human Diversity* by Charles Murray. It shows that in most cases a father does offer significantly more value beyond his genes. In no case are genes to blame for more than 60% of outcomes. In fact, genes only account for half the outcomes in cognitive function, educational attainment, and leisure interests. The rest is the environment the person lives in.

<div class="float-right">

##### Shared environment:

* parental income
* occupation
* education
* age
* parenting practices
* family structure
* the quality of the neighborhood
* quality of the schools

##### Nonshared environment:

* accidents
* illnesses
* trauma
* birth order
* sex
* sibling interaction
* parental treatment
* extrafamilial networks

</div>

##### Polderman Meta-Analysis of Twin Studies[^7]
| Trait | Shared environment | Nonshared environment | Genes |
|:--------------|------:|------:|------:|
| **Personality** |||
| Specific personality disorders | 1% | 56% | 44% |
| Emotionally unstable personality | 19% | 46% | 35% |
| **Abilities** |||
| Higher-level cognitive functions | 18% | 27% | 55% |
| Calculation functions | 13% | 32% | 56% |
| Mild mental retardation | 22% | 45% | 33% |
| **Social behavior** |||
| Work and employment | 0% | 63% | 37% |
| Intimate relationships | 0% | 65% | 35% |
| Family relationships | 6% | 66% | 28% |
| Conduct disorders | 14% | 38% | 48% |
| Recreation and leisure | 18% | 27% | 55% |
| Educational attainment | 25% | 26% | 50% |
| Problems related to upbringing | 34% | 40% | 27% |
| Basic interpersonal interactions | 36% | 34% | 30% |

So, based on these data does the presence or absence of a father matter? The presence of a father in the household would largely be captured in the shared environment. So, we would want to look at the things where the shared environment matters most to see what influence they might have.  Emotionally unstable personality, Mild mental retardation, Educational attainment, Problems related to upbringing, Basic interpersonal interactions are all in the list of things most strongly affected by shared environment and thus candidates for fatherly influence. These all like personality aspects we would expect to have influence in the outcomes we care about.

The nonshared environment looms large in these data. What does that mean? It takes into account our personal choices and the stochasticity of life in the measured outcomes. One thing poverty offers is more opportunity for things to go wrong and less opportunity to fix those things if they do. If you compound that with what Moynihan called *ghetto culture*, I think this amplifies the negative aspects of nonshared environment caused outcomes.

### Why did the Black family continue to disintegrate?

Moynihan thought *ghetto culture* was a serious problem affecting family creation. I have read anthropological accounts of people from *ghettos*. While I believe they were written in good faith, I do not think they really make me understand what that means fundamentally. This is one of those cases where I expect lived experience really makes a difference. We can look at other things however for a more explicit understanding. Consider for a moment, crime statistics.

##### FBI 2018 Crime Statistics[^8]
| Offence charged | **White** | **Black** | **Native** | **Asian** |
|:--------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Population percentage | 76.3% | 13.4% | 1.3% | 5.9% |
| **Percent distribution** |||||
| Murder | 44.0% | 53.3% | 2.1% | 1.2% |
| Rape | 68.1% | 26.6% | 1.4% | 1.5% |
| Robbery | 43.5% | 54.2% | 1.0% | 1.0% |
| Aggravated Assault | 61.9% | 33.7% | 2.3% | 1.7% |
| Burglary | 68.1% | 29.4% | 1.2% | 1.1% |
| **Relative Representation** |||||

| Robbery | .57 | 4.04 | .77 | .17 |
| Aggravated Assault | .81 | 2.51 | 1.77 | .29 |

<div class="float-right">
{{< thumbd src="prison.png" title="Prison Population" target="prison" width="200" class="rounded" >}}
</div>

These FBI data show that Black Americans, almost certainly males, commit 2 to 4 times the crime they would be expected to if crime were proportional to race. As unpopular an opinion it is to hold, I think there is some merit in what Moynihan was suggesting. The culture may be promoting behavior that is counter productive. If the nonshared environment is so important to life outcomes and some people live in an environment with much larger chances of unfortunate circumstances, due to crime, you would expect a larger negative influence from those factors.

There is no reason why the nonshared environment would have to lean toward negative outcomes. In fact, if you look at Asians, it seems almost certain that they receive a net benefit from the random circumstances they encounter in their lives. They are under represented in crime statistics and are therefore under represented in prison[^9].

### Does Crime Affect Mating Choices?

Most men I know believe that women largely control the economics of mating. Just like women control most household spending (70%), they also control most of the decision making when it comes to sex. There are obvious biological reasons for this. Human males generate hundreds of billions of spermatozoa over a lifetime while females only have 100s of ovum available for fertilization. Women also bear a larger portion of the burden of carrying the baby to term inside their bodies. Therefore women need to be more discriminating (a billion times more perhaps). Unsurprisingly, they are.

<div class="float-right">
{{< thumbd src="okcupid.png" title="Woman Discriminate" target="okcupid" width="200" class="rounded" >}}
</div>

Do the high rates of incarceration among Black males affect mating in the Black community? I imagine it could. We know, for example that woman are extremely discriminating in their opinions of males. According to OKCupid[^10], a popular dating site, woman rate the largest proportion of men, on a scale of 0 to 5, as ***1***. An incredible 80% of men are, according women on OKCupid, below average. While harsh sounding, and hilarious when you consider the standard narrative that men are the ones who objectify women (rather than the opposite as these data suggest), it does make sense when you consider the high costs of reproducing placed on women.

I wonder if the disappearance of enough men from the mating market causes women to make drastically worse choices? Could slightly higher propensity for crime lead few men on the market? Sure. Could fewer men on the mating market lead to women making worse choices? Maybe, but you would think that men in prison are probably pretty bad choices to being with. But, if there was a tipping point where so many men were gone that women who continued to discriminate lost access to the mating market at all, you could see a positive feedback loop manifest. That loop would force women to make much worse choices than they would normally make and this might lead to them rightly not wanting to have live with the men who father their children. If that might lead to more young people growing up without the moderating influence of a father that could lead them to committing more crime, thus exacerbating the problem.

That positive feedback loop might create a *War on Crime* and the *Super Predator* idea our President Elect worked so diligently to keep off the street, exacerbating the problem yet further.

### What Can be Done?

My father would say to my mother when he was frustrated with her lack of interest in her parental responsibilities, "mother is a verb!". This seems appropriate advice now, except directed at the fathers. Just because you can abandon your children does not mean that you should Stop it! Be a father. As the old fashioned people used to say, "Make an honest women out of her!"

Sex is great. Sex with someone you love is greater. Children are great. Children you are proud to call your own (rather than pretending they are not) are better.

Women need to maintain their discriminating impulse even when it feels like it has a high cost.

> Jessica was good at attracting boys, but less good at holding on to them. She fell in love hard and fast. She desperately wanted to be somebody's real girlfriend, but she always ended up the other girl, the mistress, the one they saw on the down-low, the girl nobody claimed. Boys called up to her window after they'd dropped off their main girls, the steady ones they referred to as wives. Jessica still had her fun, but her fun was somebody elses trouble, and for a wild girl at the dangerous age, the trouble could get big. — <cite>Adrian Nicole Leblanc, Random Family</cite>

Don't be like Jessica!

Like all problems, these need to be solved at home, by the people suffering the consequences. One thing the public could do that might help would be to adjust welfare benefits to provide greater support to nuclear families. Remember though, as Thomas Sowell pointed out earlier, "*One key fact that keeps getting ignored is that the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits every year since 1994.*" People who maintain traditional family structures do not need the help.
