After listening to an astounding [NPR story](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/538092649/say-goodbye-to-x-y-should-community-colleges-abolish-algebra) about California community colleges dropping its intermediate algebra requirement because of racial differences in success in the class, I decided I would see if I could teach my son algebra. He had just finished the first grade. Let's see how it went.

To set the stage for this tale, we need to travel back to May, 2017. My son Zev had just finished 1st grade. He was enrolled at *the best* public elementary school in the city. I assumed he would be getting a decent education. I don't really know what that means, but I assumed it would be like mine. So, when he finished 1st grade only having progressed to addition of 1 digit numbers I was rather disappointed. I decided it was time for me to take a more active role in his education. We studied time tables for a couple weeks and while he had not yet memorized the times tables, he memorized all the squares $x^2âˆ£{12 \atop 0}$ and so he could calculate any value with addition in a few seconds.

This was a good start. By June he was rocking long multiplication.
